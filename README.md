# BeneficialRole

This repository contains the slides and accompanying paper for the presentation
"Beneficial Role of Humans and AI in a Machine Age of the Telco EcoSystem" given
at the Digital Transformation World - TM Forum, Nice, France, 14 - 16 May, 2018. 

The presentation is given by Simon Thompson, Head of Practice, Big Data and 
Customer Experience, BT Research and Innovation, UK, on behalf of Steve Cassidy
(BT), Chris Simons (University of the West of England, Bristol, UK) and Jay 
Parrett, Aria Networks, UK. 

Here is the abstract:

The adoption of new technology in the telecommunications industry raises challenges,
particularly when exploiting advances in artficial intelligence (AI) (e.g. dynamic
optimisation and machine learning). Indeed, opinions have been expressed that
AI will either replace everyone, gain sentience or not be able to contribute to anything
meaningful where human creativity and innovation are required. Nonetheless,
the need to exploit recent advances in AI in a dynamic telecommunications ecosystem
of Internet of Things (IoT), 5G and rapidly diminishing margins should be unquestionable.
In a recent panel of automation in Software Defined Networks (SDN) and
Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), the CTO of a large European Operator cited
the most significant problem to solve was not the use of AI in automation but rather
its introduction alongside human operators. However, recent research in the area of
interactive optimisation and machine learning at the University of the West of England,
Bristol, UK, has incorporated humans "in-the-loop" with AI and found that
superior solutions can be achieved by humans and AI working together rather than
separately. To examine these issues, we present relevant case studies from BT Research
Laboratories and Aria Networks / Facebook. We analyse the case study evidence and
recent advances in AI research to carefully discern the crucial causative factors that
underpin the situation. Based on the analysis, we conclude that the case for engineers
working collaboratively "in-the-loop" with AI is compelling, and will be of great 
benefitto telecommunications businesses and the people involved in the areas of process
automation and dynamic optimisation.
